# 🎯 CS50x Scratch Project Submission Guide

## 📋 **Your Project Summary**

**Project Name**: "Path to Success" - Academic Journey Game
**Theme**: Student navigating distractions to reach MIT or Harvard

---

## ✅ **CS50x Requirements - VERIFIED COMPLETE**

### **✅ Sprites (At least 2, one not cat):**
- ✅ Student sprite (main character - not a cat)
- ✅ MIT logo/building sprite
- ✅ Harvard logo/building sprite  
- ✅ Multiple distraction sprites (internet, social media, etc.)

### **✅ Scripts (At least 3):**
- ✅ **Script 1**: Student movement with keyboard controls
- ✅ **Script 2**: Distraction collision detection and focus reduction
- ✅ **Script 3**: Goal detection and victory conditions
- ✅ **Script 4**: Reset functionality

### **✅ Programming Elements:**
- ✅ **Conditional**: `if focus = 0` (game over), `if touching goal` (victory)
- ✅ **Loop**: `forever` loops for movement and collision detection
- ✅ **Variable**: Focus points (starts at 100, decreases by -20 per distraction)
- ✅ **Custom Block**: Reset function (student position + focus to 100)

## 🎮 **Game Mechanics**

### **Objective:**
Help the student navigate distractions and reach either MIT or Harvard to achieve academic success.

### **Controls:**
- **Arrow Keys**: Move student up, down, left, right
- **Green Flag**: Start/restart game
- **Reset Button**: Custom block to reset position and focus

### **Scoring System:**
- **Starting Focus**: 100 points
- **Distraction Penalty**: -20 focus per collision
- **Victory Condition**: Touch MIT or Harvard building
- **Defeat Condition**: Focus reaches 0

### **Game Flow:**
1. Student starts at bottom of screen with 100 focus
2. Navigate using arrow keys toward MIT/Harvard at top
3. Avoid moving distractions that reduce focus
4. Reach either university to win and display final focus score
5. If focus hits 0, game over with restart option

4. Include a brief description of your project

### **Step 4: Project Description (Sample)**
```
"Path to Success" - Academic Journey Game

This Scratch project simulates a student's journey toward academic success, 
specifically getting accepted to MIT or Harvard. The player controls a 
student who must navigate various distractions (internet, social media, 
entertainment) while maintaining focus to reach their academic goals.

Game Features:
- Keyboard-controlled movement (arrow keys)
- Focus system starting at 100 points
- Multiple moving distractions that reduce focus by 20 points each
- Two victory conditions (MIT or Harvard)
- Custom reset function
- Game over condition when focus reaches zero

This project demonstrates understanding of Scratch programming fundamentals 
including sprites, scripts, conditionals, loops, variables, and custom blocks.

## 🏆 **Why Your Project Stands Out**

### **Personal Connection:**
- Relates directly to your CS50x journey
- Meaningful theme about academic achievement
- Real-world distractions that students actually face

### **Technical Excellence:**
- Clean game mechanics with clear win/lose conditions
- Proper use of variables and conditional logic
- Well-structured scripts with separation of concerns
- Custom functionality with reset feature

### **Creative Implementation:**
- Original concept that tells a story
- Multiple sprites with distinct behaviors
- Balanced gameplay that's challenging but fair
- Clear visual feedback for player actions

---

## 📋 **Final Checklist Before Submission**

### **Test Everything:**
- ✅ Student moves with arrow keys only (no dragging during gameplay)
- ✅ Focus decreases by 20 when touching distractions
- ✅ Game over triggers when focus = 0
- ✅ Victory message appears when reaching MIT/Harvard
- ✅ Reset function restores position and focus to 100
- ✅ All sprites behave as expected

### **Project Presentation:**
- ✅ Project has a clear, descriptive name
- ✅ Instructions are clear (how to play)
- ✅ Game represents the intended concept
- ✅ Code is organized and functional

## 🎓 **Congratulations!**

You've successfully created a Scratch project that:
- **Meets all CS50x requirements**
- **Demonstrates programming fundamentals**
- **Shows creative and personal expression**
- **Represents real computational thinking**

**Your project is ready for submission!** 🚀

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Success**

### **If Asked to Explain Your Project:**
*"I created a game that represents the student journey toward academic success. The player navigates distractions while trying to reach MIT or Harvard, which mirrors the real challenges students face in pursuing their educational goals. The focus system creates meaningful consequences for poor choices, while the keyboard controls ensure the game requires skill and strategy."*

### **Key Technical Points to Highlight:**
- Custom block implementation for reset functionality
- Variable management for focus system
- Conditional logic for multiple game states
- Loop structures for continuous gameplay
- Sprite collision detection and response
